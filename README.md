## Adaptive Model for Character Locomotion
Our system takes as input a character model, ie. a mesh geometry, a rigged skeleton with kinematic animations and an IK system applied to the feet bones, on top of a simple proxy-geometry and rigid body used for balance control and collision processing. Then, it builds a real-time locomotion model that combines a global controller to adjust the overall character pose based on the ground slope, enabling tilting and balancing behaviors, with an IK system to adapt the model to non-flat terrains.

In order to reproduce two-ways interactions between the model and the environment, the character deforms the soft ground based on a custom-made light-weight force model for feet-to-ground contact, driven by the kinematics on the input motion and the nature of the terrain. Finally, a versatile model based on Hooke's law is used for ground deformation, parametrized by the Young modulus in compression and by the Poisson ratio in lateral material displacement.
